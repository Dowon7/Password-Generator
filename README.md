# Password Generator 

This project was an assignment with the goal to create a password generator that allows the user to generate a password with a variety of options.

The main focus of this project was to further work on my Javascript skills and dip my hands into user interactions with a webpage.

The user is allowed to generate a random password with a character minimum of 8, and a maximum of 128. Alongside options for:
*special characters 
*numbers
*uppercase letters 
*lowercase letters

We were given an HTML and CSS file to work with, so that most of the work went into the Javascript.
